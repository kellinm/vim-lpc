BACKGROUND:
----------
I have been writing LPC for almost 20 years and it wasn't until
just a few years ago that I discovered the builtin LPC syntax
for Vim. Unfortunately, the $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim file
only checks the first twelve lines to differentiate between
a C language file and an LPC language file.

I finally got tired of modding that file and decided to do
something less hacky. I figured the least I could do is share
this in the hopes that some other LPC coder out there can
use it.

I have tested this as a stand alone in .vim and as a Pathogen
plugin and confirmed it works in both cases.

Let me know if you have a feature request or send a pull
request if you add something you think might be useful.
